      <p>appleTV-slideshow is [the start of] a jQuery plugin that attemps to recreate the "Float" slideshow from the Apple TV (launched September 2010) using smooth webkit animations <strong>(webkit/chrome/safari only)</strong> of photos pulled from Flickr.</p>
      
      <p>I just guessed the values of how to animate the photos upwards, the basic idea is here, but getting real accuracy would require a lot more work, so I'm putting this project here as a starting point.</p>
      
      <p>The real slideshow has photos animating individually with at least 3 different speeds, here I have them all animating the same.</p>

      <p>This was done for fun as an experiment in a few hours, though could be used practically with some work as a slideshow within a div container on a page. The following TODOs represent some more work I'd like to do to make the effect more like the original.</p>

      <p><a href='#' id='launch'>View the slideshow</a></p>

      <h3>Todo</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>append 3 layers into container element and split images amongst them as DOM children</li>
        <li>add different durations to the photos</li>
        <li>spread them out to take up more screen real estate</li>
        <li>fix 3d flip to occur after Y translate is done</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <code>$('#slideshow').appleTV({source: 'flickr', nsid: '39474694@N00', lang: 'en-us'});</code>
